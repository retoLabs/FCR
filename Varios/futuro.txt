Frameworks:
Vue was developed and first released in 2014 by Evan You and is widely used by companies based in China. The main advantage of this framework is its step-by-step implementation. VueJS has a comprehensive architecture that is easily applied in practice. Also, Vue-based apps can be combined with other complex solutions to create new projects.

Ember :This framework has existed for years. Over time Ember.js has shown how capable its team is in maintaining the framework and integrating up-to-date standards into it. And even things change, the old developments remain in their places.

Some programmers contribute to the development of Ember the most. And they also get to deal with JavaScript standardization. Ember.js has made a more significant impact on JS over the past few years than other frameworks.

Angular, is a TypeScript-based JavaScript framework by Google. It was released in 2010, with its latest version – Angular 8 – appearing in May 2019. Overall, Angular with versions 2 and above has become way better than it used to be. The update removed all the unnecessary complexities making the framework easier to learn.

Some might say that Angular’s performance is on the lower side. However, it’s only fair for the first version, as its performance now does prove to be quite high. The framework adopted the practice popularized by React – one-way data flow and immutable data. Hence, Angular will only update the data changes once. And each change detection makes a quick check of the object’s reference instead of checking all its values.
